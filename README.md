## PROJECT INTRODUCTION

Our project aims to create a virtual laboratory experience for middle school students who do not have access to physical laboratory facilities. With the use of desktop and mobile applications, we aim to provide an engaging and interactive learning experience that will allow students to perform laboratory experiments and activities that they may not have been able to otherwise. This project seeks to bridge the gap in access to laboratory resources and provide an innovative solution to enhance science education for middle school students.

## RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS
assuming that you have already set up the Flutter development environment on your machine:
The official documentation provides guidance on setting up Flutter for the first time.
"https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install"

1. Clone the repository: Use the git clone command to clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and run the flutter pub get command to install all the required dependencies for the project.
3. Run the project: To run the project on a device or emulator, use the flutter run command. This will build the project and launch it on the device or emulator.


## HOW TO USE
1. Launch the application: The student will open the virtual laboratory application on their desktop or mobile device.
2. Select an experiment: The student will select an experiment or activity from the list of available options.
3. Perform the experiment: The application will guide the student through the steps necessary to perform the experiment, including any necessary safety precautions.
4. Draw conclusions: Based on their observations, and draw conclusions about the experiment.
5. Repeat or try another experiment: The student may repeat the experiment to confirm their results or move on to another experiment to continue learning.

## FEATURES
1. Nepali language support: The virtual laboratory is available in the Nepali language, making it accessible to a wider audience in Nepal.
2. Aligned with the national syllabus: The experiments and activities in the virtual laboratory are designed to align with the national syllabus, ensuring that students are learning relevant and important topics.
3. Easy to use interface: The virtual laboratory has a user-friendly interface, making it easy for students to navigate and perform experiments without needing significant technical expertise.
4. Available on desktop and mobile: The virtual laboratory is available on both desktop and mobile devices, providing flexibility for students to access the platform in the way that is most convenient for them.
5. Available online and offline: The virtual laboratory is accessible both online and offline, making it accessible to students who may not have reliable internet access at all times.
6. Interactive simulations: The virtual laboratory includes interactive simulations that allow students to manipulate variables and observe the effects in real-time, helping to reinforce their understanding of scientific concepts.

## WHO ARE WE
